PIG example, it works with a RDF foaf dataset:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_(ontology)
The program verifies if in the graph all the users are connected 
to each other within six steps.
If the answer is positive, it returns all the possible pairs and
one of the 'path' that connect the two users.
